# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Overview 

This is a random password generator. Users are able to choose the types of requirements they'd like in a password by choosing options from a series of prompts. 

## User Experience

```
In this website, the user is able to generate a random password with numbers, special characters, uppercase, lowercase, and choose their desired password length. 

We developed the generator to be inclusive to the user requirements by giving several choices for the user. They are able to mix in match the requirement to create a unique password. The passwords are coded to generate randomly so no two users will have the same outcome.

Upon entering the website they will see a the generate password button that actives the window prompts that allow them to navigate the generation process.

Once the user completes the prompt questions, they will be able to see their password generate with the text block.
